# Lovett
A Rusty Pi Application Framework

![Lovett Logo](/assets/lovett.png "Lovett")

## Lovett is a Framework

Lovett was designed to create small graphical applications using Rust, a framebuffer, and GPIO pins on a Rasbperry PI.

## Docs

You can read the docs [here!](https://kcculhwch.github.io/lovett/lovett/)

Warning the API is not stable so you can count on breaking changes. But if you are using it please let me know!

This is WIP and I haven't finished thinking through how to implement it in a generic way. So I'm totally open to suggests and pull requests.

## Lovett is used by SilviaPiPID

I started this framework to abstract the work I was doing on a little application used to manage the PID on my expresso machine. You can check it out on [hackaday.](https://hackaday.io/project/174338-silviapipid)

## Lovett is a big work in progress and needs lots of love

* Lovett needs a test suite
* Lovett needs some more architectural work
* Lovett needs optimization
* Lovett needs people with more experience in Rust to make it better
